# IRTM-Turbulence-Restoration-Sequences
These short-wave infrared videos demonstrate the atmospheric turbulence mitigation results achieved by our proposed algorithm. In these videos, 'DoG' refers to the results obtained using only image enhancement based on the Difference of Gaussian filter, while 'Ours' represents the outcomes produced by our proposed method that combines DoG with a deep neural network. Clearly, our approach achieves significant atmospheric turbulence mitigation in short-wave infrared videos, effectively reducing jitter and distortion while enhancing detail clarity.
